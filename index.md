# Samantha Hartzell

Welcome! I recently joined the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.pdx.edu/civil-environmental-engineering/) at Portland State University, where I am an Assistant Professor in the area of water resources. I currently have open positions for a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher to join my research group in Fall 2021. Please [contact me](samhartz.github.io/contact) if you are interested in working together.

My research interests lie in the area of ecohydrology -- studying the way in which water moves through ecosystems, both natural and urban. I am particularly interested in the impacts of vegetation on the movement of water, carbon, and energy between the land surface and atmosphere, and vice versa. I study some of the ways in which plants have altered their hydaulic and photosynthetic strategies to survive in water-limited ecosystems, and what this means for the future of natural and agro-ecosystems impacted by climate change. To better understand inherently stochastic and nonlinear processes such as rainfall and ecosystem responses I use computational modeling as well as tools from probability theory and nonlinear dynamics.

I completed my PhD work at Princeton University under the supervision of Amilcare Porporato, focusing on the effects of CAM photosynthesis and plant succulence on water movement through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. I did my undergraduate studies in Civil & Environmental Engineering at MIT.
